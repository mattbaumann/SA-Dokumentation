\subsubsection{previous work / descisions taken}
It's the rampup-meeting, there has not been a meeting before. As discussed verbally, I prepared myself by reading into the reference material.

\subsubsection{meeting summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item priorize the work items
    \item journalize the meetings with summary and descisions
    \item overall goals in the SA
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Good non-functional requirements (SMART)
            \item architecture descisions, explain reasons behind directions taken
            \item redactional qualities, simplicity, code quality, high-quality writing \url{https://ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=13194}
            \item milestone reviews, each week review meeting, send information 24 in advance 
        \end{itemize}
    \item Good example of a BA well done: \url{https://ifs.hsr.ch/index.php?id=13194}

        \end{itemize}
    \item architectures I would like to pursue further
        \begin{itemize}

            \item Webserver proxy constructs the page, see \url{https://www.mosaic9.org/}
            \item Traditional setup, as a reference (Application-Server generates page, API calls by JS)
